# Twitter Many to many
## Goals
* Implement both sides of a many to many relationship
* Practice keeping groups of data related to classes on the class as a class variable
* Demonstrate single source of truth by not storing collections of objects on other objects
* Demonstrate single source of truth by not storing one object in multiple collections

How to follow along. We'll be reading through the specs as we write some code and test out the behavior. The `01_examples_spec.rb` file contains the rspec code we'll be running as we demonstrate what we know about relationships so far. The `02_exercise_spec.rb` file contains the rspec code you'll use when you work together to complete the many to many relationship between users and tweets in our twitter domain.
